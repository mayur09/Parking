					We are a group of individuals committed to providing best quality information to the students seeking to step 																				                    into professional colleges for higher education.
				    <br/>
					Being from Engineering colleges from Gujarat, we discovered a big gap in qualititive information to help them                   decide on selecting the college available. With the increase in number of colleges , the complexity had                   increased and there is even more intense need to find a solution to address the college selection dilemma.
                   <br/> 
			    	Our goal is to provide relevant, accurate information of colleges in  a very user friendly manner so as to make                   	the optimum use of it. We constantly endeavor to stretch ourselves to improve ourselves and would welcome any                   	suggestions.

				<div class="acc-container">
					<p>On the basis of college prediction , A student can get a estimate of the possible branches/colleges He/She                       will make through in the current year . It helps him to make a wise decision regarding the best choices for                       branch/college selection , Statistically More than 30% students choose wrong branches/college because of                       limited information of cutoff ranks for various colleges/branches .</br>

				<div class="acc-container">
					<p> Today it is easy to access the quality of a college is easy to determine due to numerous surveys, rankings  						and grading processes undertaken by several institutions. For instance, the World Bank ‘Technical Education 						Quality Improvement Program’ has identified the best 120 engineering colleges across the country excluding 										                  		IITs by way of a survey conducted over a period of five years. The details of this survey are available at 	   						the website www.npiu.nic.in. Even the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) website, where all  						colleges have to disclose certain information, is a direct indicator to the quality of a college. 
 						However, the best way to determine the quality of a college is to go there directly and talk to third and 	        				fourth year students.<a href="#" style="color:#2d5c88">See more</a>

				<div class="acc-container">
					<p> The best course for a student is based solely on his or her area of interest. However, for those possessing 						good mathematical skills there is a huge scope in the subjects of Electronics and Computer Engineering 	 	 						(ECE) and Electronics and Electrical Engineering (EEE) as nearly 80 per cent of jobs are in the software  	 						sector.</br> Also, it is always better to opt for a core engineering subject rather than a blend like 	 						 						mechatronics as core subjects provide a strong foundation besides a broad scope.<a href="#" style="color:          				#2d5c88">See more</a>

					<p> Try to be among the top 20 per cent in the class. You do not have to be a topper. Also, it essential to     					improve upon soft skills, like verbal ability, in the four years of engineering education. Write academic   						paper and organize events at the college level. If you posses core domain knowledge with soft skills, you   						are a hot cake for the industry.<a href="#" style="color:#2d5c88">See more</a>

			<div class="acc-container">
					<p> Most civil engineering students opt for higher education. They have good career prospects in design         				automation, structural engineering, transportation engineering etc. 
 						But most companies hesitate in recruiting girls. However, one can set up professional testing lab as there  						is acute shortage for structural stability labs and others.

						<p> This question has been raking the minds of parents and students for years. For colleges to run          					successfully they have to posses the credentials of good infrastructure and faculty does. Before taking 							admission, it is very important to study a college very carefully first and then examine the course. 
 							Also, a student’s aptitude has to be considered before choosing a course. 
 							For those who have a feel for numbers and logical ability, Computer Science Engineering (CSE) is a good  							option. While IT and CSE courses only require proper guidance, having hands-on machinery experience at  							the college is essential for core engineering subjects.
